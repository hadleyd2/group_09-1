## 4. Dashboard Proposal

### Dashboard Description

This app will have features for data exploration and data analysis. Data exploration uses a density of Airbnb listing prices for Barcelona, Spain and allows the user to select a categorical variable to view a violin plot. The default density is for all listings. Grouping options include District, Room Type,and Minimum Night Stay.

For data analysis, users can filter the dataset using price, distance from city center, or minimum night stay. Then, a simple linear regression is run using an independent variable (x-axis variable) chosen by the user against the dependent variable price. Data transformations: logarithms, square root, or reciprocal are available for either variable which may improve the linear relationship. Finally, a scatterplot with the linear regression line is presented.

### Usage Scenarios

Maria lives in Barcelona and wants to rent out her apartment while she travels for two weeks. She decides to use Airbnb.com, and her friend has offered to manage the rentals while she is away. Maria wants a listing price that is competitive, but not too low. She knows her apartment is in a very desirable neighourhood for tourists. To guide in the price selection, she wants to compare her apartment to similar Airbnb listings. To maximize occupancy, she wants to write a description emphasizing characteristics strongly related to higher listing prices. Maria visits our dashboard and uses the data exploration section to see the distribution of listing prices for her neighborhood. To see the average listing price for comparable apartments, she uses the data analysis section to first eliminates noncomparables and outliers. Then, she selects an x-axis variable and can use her apartment's characteristics to see the mean listing price for similar listings. She decides to charge 10% over the mean. By repeating this process for a few different independent variables, she arrives at a reasonable price and knows which characteristics to stress in her listing.
